### Technical Implementation
The instructions are implemented through an HTML script that dynamically generates the help window content and handles user interactions. JavaScript functions are used to open the help window, manage click events outside the window, and close the window when necessary. Event propagation is carefully managed to ensure that the help window behaves as expected.
